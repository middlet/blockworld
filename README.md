experiments with angular.js and three.js

## demo 1
 
build a plane with dimensions [31.7900417, 35.2054417] to [31.7810028, 35.2206583]. rotate the plane with controls.

## demo 2

data defines the size of the plane. data covers a number of regions which
can be plotted on top of the plane.

## running the code

you need to serve the fdirectory in which the code is hosted. you can configure apache etc or you can run a simple web server. in python this can be done via:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer PORT
```

then  you can browse to the content as needed
